Finding a Shared Motif
Topics: String Algorithms

Problem:
A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member
of the collection. We say that a common substring is a longest common
substring if there does not exist a longer common substring. For example,
"CG" is a common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA", but it is not as
long as possible; in this case, "CGTA" is a longest common substring of
"ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".

Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique; for a
simple example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest common substrings of "AACC"
and "CCAA".

Given:
A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA
format.

Return:
A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist,
you may return any single solution.)

Sample Dataset:
>Rosalind_1
GATTACA
>Rosalind_2
TAGACCA
>Rosalind_3
ATACA

Sample Output:
AC
